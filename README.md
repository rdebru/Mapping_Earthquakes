# **Mapping Earthquakes with JS & APIs**
## **Overview of Mapping Earthquakes**

* Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

* In this challenge we will create a map of all earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. As well we will add tectonic plate data and major earthquake data to the map.




### Purpose
* The purpose of the assigment is to

- Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Add Major Earthquake Data(> 4.5 magnitude)
- Add an Additional Map
